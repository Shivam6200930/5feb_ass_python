    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. An object is an instance of a class. It has the properties and behaviors that are defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might have a class called Dog. This class would define the properties that a dog has, such as its name, breed, and age. It would also define the behaviors that a dog has, such as barking, eating, and sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could then create objects from the Dog class. Each object would have its own unique set of values for the properties that are defined by the class. For example, you might have a dog named Fido who is a Golden Retriever and is 5 years old. You might also have a dog named Spot who is a Beagle and is 2 years old.\n",

    "Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (base class or superclass).\n",

    "It promotes code reusability, as common attributes and methods can be defined in a base class and inherited by multiple derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii).polymorphism:=\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",

    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.\n",

    "Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they possess.\n",
